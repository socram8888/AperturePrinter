This was a triumph.

I'm making a note here:

[center][size=2]HUGE SUCCESS.

[b]Dear <<Subject Name Here>>.

I'm not even angry.

I'm being so sincere right now.

Even though you broke my heart.
[img=brokenhearth.png]

27

And killed me.

And tore me to pieces.
[img=explosion.png]

29
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,354
And threw every piece into a fire.

As they burned it hurt because

I was so happy for you!

Now these points of data

We're releasing on time.

So I'm GLaD. I got burned.

Go ahead and leave me.

I think I prefer to stay inside.

Maybe you'll find someone else
